# writeBrain
Hey there! This is writeBrain, a place where you can do writing sprints, save them, and generate insights about what you've written.

## How's it work?
There's two parts to writeBrain—writing and reviewing. 

On the home page, you'll find a timer to set for your sprint. Set the timer, and get to writing! But before you do that, be sure to choose a Mood from the dropdown list that describes how you feel before writing. Once you're finished writing, you'll select another Mood that describes how you feel after you've finished the Sprint. You can then create or select a Story to add the Sprint to. Stories are just collections of Sprints to keep you organized!

After you've written a Sprint or two, you can access the second part of writeBrain—reviewing your past Sprints. Navigate to the Story Bar on the left to see a list of all the Stories you've created. Click on any Story to see all the associated Sprints. From there, you can choose a Sprint to view more information. 

Once you're looking at an individual Sprint, you'll be able to read what you've written. Even better, you can see some insights into your work! You'll see your two moods along with basic stats such as word count, sprint time, and WPM. On top of that, you'll see how positive or negative the Sprint is. 

## The future
The future for writeBrain is exciting! I'll be diving further into NLP in order to derive better insights from Sprints. I hope to add live insights and statistics as the Sprint is being written. I'll also be adding additional features to help the writing process like story dice to roll when you need an idea quick.
